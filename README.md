## üéØ Purpose

This project serves as an interactive educational tool that demonstrates why users should **NEVER** enter their cryptocurrency seed phrases on any website. When users attempt to enter text, they immediately receive a comprehensive security warning explaining the risks.

## üîí Key Features

- **Immediate Security Education**: Triggers warning as soon as users start typing
- **No Data Collection**: Runs entirely client-side, no data is stored or transmitted
- **Comprehensive Security Lessons**: Explains what seed phrases are, what they allow, and best practices
- **SEO Optimized**: Helps users find critical security information when searching for "seed phrase checker" or similar terms
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices to reach the maximum audience

## üö® Important Security Notice

**This is an EDUCATIONAL website only.** It does not actually check seed phrases or perform any blockchain operations. The entire purpose is to intercept users who might be searching for dangerous "seed phrase checkers" and educate them about security risks.
