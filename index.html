                <p>No. There is no legitimate website that can ‚Äúcheck‚Äù or ‚Äúverify‚Äù your seed phrase. Entering it anywhere online can result in immediate loss of funds.</p>

                <h3 id="what-can-someone-do-with-my-seed-phrase">What can someone do with my seed phrase?</h3>
                <p>Your seed phrase is the master key to your wallet. Anyone with it can restore your wallet, move or steal all assets, and take full control‚Äîwithout your permission.</p>

                <h3 id="is-my-seed-phrase-safe-to-share">Is it ever safe to share a seed phrase?</h3>
                <p>No. Never share it with anyone. No support agent, exchange, wallet, or website needs your seed phrase.</p>

                <h3 id="can-i-check-if-my-seed-phrase-was-compromised">Can I check if my seed phrase was compromised?</h3>
                <p>There‚Äôs no safe way to submit it for checking. Treat any site asking for your seed as malicious. If you‚Äôve entered it anywhere, assume compromise and act immediately.</p>

                <h3 id="is-my-12-or-24-word-secret-recovery-phrase-the-same-as-a-seed-phrase">Is my 12 or 24‚Äëword Secret Recovery Phrase the same as a seed phrase?</h3>
